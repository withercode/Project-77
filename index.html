          <h1> Project on console </h1>
    <p> Visual studio code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.[10] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>
    <p> To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
<script>
    console.log("My First Concole Project");
    var first_name = "Vishnu";
    var last_name = "KR";
    console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));
    var a = 10;
    var b = 5;
    var add = a + b;
    console.log(add);
    var subtract = a - b;
    console.log(subtract);
    var multiply = a * b;
    console.log(multiply);
    var divide = a / b;
    console.log(divide);
